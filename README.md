# WaveShare ESP32 S3 SIM7670G IoT

This project is an advanced IoT tracking device based on the WaveShare ESP32 S3 SIM7670G IoT board. It integrates motion sensing, GPS, and multiple connectivity options (WiFi and Cellular) to create a versatile asset tracker for car and serves mainly to turn on dash cam to recrd events if car has been shocked.
The device is highly configurable via a web interface and is optimized for low-power operation.

## Key Features

- **Power Management:**
  - Utilizes the MAX1704X (battery guage).
  - Supports deep sleep modes to conserve battery.
  - Multiple wakeup sources: motion (IMU), timer, and power button/VBUS connection.
  - Battery level monitoring and automatic shutdown on critical battery levels.
  - TODO : add output to retain a relay of phone charger in the car to be on for specific time ( ex 5 minute ) after cars is turned off

- **Motion Detection:**
  - Uses an MPU6500 IMU with its Digital Motion Processor (DMP) to detect motion.
  - Wake-on-Motion (WOM) functionality to wake the device from deep sleep.
  - Configurable motion sensitivity and thresholds via the web interface.
  - DONE : rework the init of Wake-on-motion initialization of the mpu to optimize porpoer detection and power management 
  - DONE : Enabled cycle wake up and reduced accelerometer output rate in low power mode.

- **Connectivity:**
  - **WiFi:** Can operate in both Station (STA) and Access Point (AP) modes.
  - TODO **Cellular:** Integrates the SIM modem for 4G connectivity.
  - **MQTT:** Publishes data (e.g., logs, GPS location) to an MQTT broker.
  - **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Supports firmware updates via WiFi.

- **Sleep / Periodic Wakeup**
  - support waking up each < 1h - configurable >  to take snapshot ;
    wake up -> turn on cam , sleep for 10s --> wake up & turn off camera , return to secure mode ( motion detection ) 

- **BLEUTOOTH / BLE:** 
  - TODO: broadcast BLE periodically ( maybe each 1m ? very low power needed) ( got sleep with time & flag that we are waking up for BLE ? or other approach)
  - TODO: pair with phone via web server to enable bleutooh page and its config ( start pairing process , removed paried device, reset , other config)
  - TODO: when car started -> start bleutooth and try connect to phone, upon connecting to phone :
          sync time if possible ? develop android app ? 
          when Vbus ( car running ) & phone connected and ready to receive file -> send logs from files stored in file system ? or notifications maybe ? 

- **GPS Tracking:**
  - Onboard GPS functionality provided by the SIM7080G modem.
  - Periodically acquires and can report location data (optional) .
  - TODO : when motion is detected without car started within 5m, acquire GPS position, timestamp of wake time or shock time, and store it in log
  - TODO : possibly send the gps info and timestamp to mqtt message over mqtts , or post HTTPS request from the Cellular modem when possible.

- **Configuration:**
  - Provides a web server (in AP mode or STA mode) for configuration.
  - Settings are stored in Non-Volatile Storage (NVS).
  - Configurable parameters include:
    - WiFi and MQTT credentials.
    - IMU motion detection thresholds.
    - System timing for sleep and WiFi timeouts.
    - iBeacon UUID.
    - Web server credentials.

- **Peripherals:**
  - **SD Card:** Support for data logging and file storage.
  - **Status LEDs:** Uses FastLED library to control WS2811 LEDs for status indication.
  - **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** External DS1302 for timekeeping (optional).

## Hardware Components
- **Main Board:** WaveShare ESP32 S3 SIM7670G IoT
- **PMU:** MAX1704X
- **IMU:** MPU6500
- **RTC:** DS1302 (optional)
- **Storage:** MicroSD Card Slot
- **LED:** WS2811 RGB LED (1 leds)

## Software Architecture

The firmware is built on the Arduino framework for ESP32. The codebase is modular, with distinct components for handling different hardware features.

- `src/main.cpp`: The main application entry point. It contains the primary `setup()` and `loop()` functions, managing the device's overall state (e.g., sleeping, waking, connecting to WiFi).
- `src/power/`: Manages the AXP2101 PMU, handling battery charging, power domain control, deep sleep, and wakeup reasons.
- `src/imu6500/`: Implements the motion detection logic using the MPU6500's DMP. It calibrates the sensor and provides a simple interface to check for motion events.
- `src/modem/`: Controls the SIM7080G modem. This module is responsible for initializing the modem, managing the cellular connection (GPRS), and acquiring GPS data.
- `src/wifi/`: Handles all WiFi-related tasks, including connecting as a client (STA), creating an access point (AP), running the MQTT client, and managing OTA updates.
- `src/web_server/`: Implements a web-based configuration portal. It allows the user to change various system settings, which are saved to persistent storage.
- `src/sdcard/`: Provides functions to initialize and manage the SD card.
- `src/led/`: A thread-safe controller for the status LEDs, supporting solid, blinking, and fading patterns.
- `src/rtc/`: Manages the external DS1302 Real-Time Clock.
- `src/camControl.cpp`: Simple functions to power the camera on and off.
- `src/pins.hpp`: Centralized header for all GPIO pin definitions.

## Getting Started

1.  **ESP IDF:** This project is set up to be built with ESP IDF. Open the project in an IDE like VSCode with the extension.
2.  **Configuration:**
    - When the device first starts or cannot connect to a known WiFi network, it will enter Access Point (AP) mode.
    - Connect to the WiFi network created by the device (the default is "ap_ssid").
    - Navigate to the device's IP address (usually 192.168.4.1) in a web browser.
    - Use the web interface to configure your WiFi credentials, MQTT broker details, and other settings.
3.  **Build and Upload:** Use ESP IDF to build and upload the firmware to the board.
